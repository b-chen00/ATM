# Project ATM

## Summary/Description
This project will be focusing on COVID-19. The website will visualize statistics like the number of cases, deaths, and cures in the US and other countries both individually and in proportion to total population. There will be graphs to track growth of the virus in multiple countries as well as the ability to compare them. The website is built using Python Flask, HTML, and Javascript with the python library D3 to visualize statistics.

## How to Run the Project:  
### Requirements:
Install a GCC compiler.

### Run the project:
1. Clone this repository and `cd` into that directory.
2. Use `make` to use the Makefile and generate an executable file.
3. Run the executable file using `./a.exe`.

## To-do
- Fix/improve 50 lowest confirmed cases country graph on the homepage.
  - Currently has too much space for a small graph.
  - Could convert to 50 highest confirmed cases but certain countries massively skews the graph.
